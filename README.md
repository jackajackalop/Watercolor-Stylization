# Information
This is going to be an implementation of the paper "Art-directed Watercolor Styliation of 3D Animations in Real-time" for games.

[More information on the paper can be found here](http://artineering.io/articles/Art-directed-watercolor-stylization-of-3D-animations-in-real-time/)

# TODO
1 make new scene with vertex colors, control colors, low freq textures

2 modify export code to take multiple control vertex color layers

# Build Instructions

## Asset Build Instructions

The ```meshes/export-meshes.py``` script can write mesh data including a variety of attributes (e.g., *p*ositions, *n*ormals, *c*olors, *t*excoords) from a selected layer of a blend file:

```
blender --background --python meshes/export-meshes.py -- meshes/crates.blend:1 dist/crates.pnc
```

The ```meshes/export-scene.py``` script can write the transformation hierarchy of the scene from a selected layer of a blend file, and includes references to meshes (by name):

```
blender --background --python meshes/export-scene.py -- meshes/crates.blend:1 dist/crates.scene
```

The ```meshes/export-walkmeshes.py``` script can writes vertices, normals, and triangle indicies of all meshes on a selected layer of a .blend file:

```
blender --background --python meshes/export-walkmeshes.py -- meshes/crates.blend:3 dist/crates.walkmesh
```

There is a Makefile in the ```meshes``` directory with some example commands of this sort in it as well.

## Runtime Build Instructions

The runtime code has been set up to be built with [FT Jam](https://www.freetype.org/jam/).

### Getting Jam

For more information on Jam, see the [Jam Documentation](https://www.perforce.com/documentation/jam-documentation) page at Perforce, which includes both reference documentation and a getting started guide.

On unixish OSs, Jam is available from your package manager:
```
	brew install ftjam #on OSX
	apt get ftjam #on Debian-ish Linux
```

On Windows, you can get a binary [from sourceforge](https://sourceforge.net/projects/freetype/files/ftjam/2.5.2/ftjam-2.5.2-win32.zip/download),
and put it somewhere in your `%PATH%`.
(Possibly: also set the `JAM_TOOLSET` variable to `VISUALC`.)

### Libraries

This code uses the [libSDL](https://www.libsdl.org/) library to create an OpenGL context, and the [glm](https://glm.g-truc.net) library for OpenGL-friendly matrix/vector types.
On MacOS and Linux, the code should work out-of-the-box if if you have these installed through your package manager.

If you are compiling on Windows or don't want to install these libraries globally there are pre-built library packages available in the
[kit-libs-linux](https://github.com/ixchow/kit-libs-linux),
[kit-libs-osx](https://github.com/ixchow/kit-libs-osx),
and [kit-libs-win](https://github.com/ixchow/kit-libs-win) repositories.
Simply clone into a subfolder and the build should work.

### Building

Open a terminal (or ```x64 Native Tools Command Prompt for VS 2017``` on Windows), change to the directory containing this code, and type:

```
jam
```

That's it. You can use ```jam -jN``` to run ```N``` parallel jobs if you'd like; ```jam -q``` to instruct jam to quit after the first error; ```jam -dx``` to show commands being executed; or ```jam main.o``` to build a specific file (in this case, main.cpp).  ```jam -h``` will print help on additional options.
